# SPI_ESP
A fast SPI shared library for ESP8266.<br>
Is this an alternative SPI library? NO, it's a collection of optimized methods for transfer SPI fast and maintain full compatibility with other libraries. I'm using this with some of my library for simplify code and since is shared it can be included in sketch and used for other SPI devices to maintain code clean and obtain good performances.<br>
Extremely experimental. Please do not use until I've tested carefully.
